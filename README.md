### Project Title
**Explore Weather Trends"** :sunny: :cloud:

### Description
In this project, you have analyzed local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I'm living to overall global temperature trends.
My goal was to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in my city. To do this, you followed the steps below:
1. Extracted the data from the database. To interact with the database, you needed to write a SQL query.
2. Created a line chart that compares my city’s temperatures with the global temperatures. I plotted the moving average rather than the yearly averages in order to smooth out the lines, making trends more observable.
3. Made observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and my city’s averages, as well as overall trends. There are questions which I answered:
- Is my city hotter or cooler on average compared to the global average? Has the difference been consistent over time?
- What does the overall trend look like? Is the world getting hotter or cooler? Has the trend been consistent over the last few hundred years?

### Files used
